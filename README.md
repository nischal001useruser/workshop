# Practice Page

A tiny HTML/CSS/JS practice project. Open `index.html` in your browser to try the examples.

Quick ways to run locally (PowerShell on Windows):

Open directly (no server needed):

  Start-Process "d:\\workshop\\index.html"

Run a simple local HTTP server (recommended if you plan to fetch files):

  # Python 3
  cd d:\\workshop; python -m http.server 8000
  # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

Tips & next exercises:
- Add a "remove item" button to each list item.
- Save items to `localStorage` so they persist between reloads.
- Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Enter to add item).
- Replace the counter with a small timer or stopwatch.
